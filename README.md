TODO
- make sure logging req/res is consistent with reality (re-printing outside of Fprint)
- implement timeout in client
- add verbose-aware logger for httpfs (red/stderr errors would be nice)
- implement file read/write in httpfs
- add more status codes/messages
- add global help message for httpfs
